Project Overview: My Accomplishments

 I successfully completed a mini-project in this notebook that demonstrated useful integrations of a large language model within two fundamental NLP workflows.  The key accomplishments include:

 1. Model Integration & Environment Setup

 set up the environment and libraries needed to use GPT-4.1.

 Using appropriate API authentication, secure access to the model was established.

 Ensured a stable connection for inference operations within the notebook.

 2. Text Summarisation Module

 Built a simple, functional text-summarization pipeline powered by GPT-4.1.

 Verified the model’s ability to condense long text into clear, high-quality summaries.

 showed how to modify the summariser to accommodate unique inputs.

3. Skill Extraction Module for Resumes

 developed a model-driven, lightweight resume skill-extraction tool.

 Parsed raw text to identify key technical and soft skills.

 demonstrated how LLMs can automate useful HR-related tasks.

 4. Complete Model Interaction

 Sent prompts to GPT-4.1 and validated structured, accurate responses.

 verified that the model environment is set up appropriately for complex natural language processing tasks.

 Demonstrated smooth integration and responsiveness across both modules.
